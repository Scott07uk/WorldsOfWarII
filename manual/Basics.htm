					Worlds of War II is a tick based stragtey game, which is a sequal to the original (but problematic Worlds of War).  The concept of the game is simple, to active the most power through the Worlds of War world.  The method used to achieve power is simple, you take more land.  You are however compeating together with all the other players in the game.  Most people choose to work with their own continent to collectivly achive power over the world, some even choose to work in small groups.  Whichever stance you take, its very hard to achive anything in the game without co-operation, as sure enough people will co-operate to take you down, so you must do in return.  The Worlds of War IRC network is provided so you can indeed communicate with other players quickley and effectivly.
