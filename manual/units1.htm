								<B>Infantry</B>
								<BR />
								The infantry unit is the most commonly found unit on the battlefield.  On their own they are quite ineffective but ammased they can provide quite a punch.  These units can march to a battlefield should it be on the same continent but if they have to travel then they require the landing craft to take them overseas.  They are armed with a normal rifle and will target other units that are personal based and tanks.  These units will operate against tanks but they are largley ineffective, unless in large numbers espically against the fortified Matilda MkII tank.

								<B>Commandoes</B>
								<BR />
								The commando unit is a better trained and more highley skilled version of the infantry.  These units are generally harrdier and more skilled on the battlefield.  This generally work better in lesser groups but if sent in a large group will split themselfs into smaller task forces to accomplish the goal of the mission.  These units are better armed than the standard infantry and carry a rage of rocket lanuchers and grenades, despite these weponary advances they are still not able to target planes or ships due to their height and size.  Again these units will target tanks but are not overly effective against the more heavly armoued tanks.  These units do however form a formidable opponent against jeeps as they are not well armed and have the ability to stike and take out in one fowl swoop.

								<B>Jeeps</B>
								<BR />
								The jeep unit comprises of a normal jeep with a browning machine gun mounted on the rear (not shown), this unit is highly movbile and can be used very successfull for hit and run attack on infantry batallions.  This unit however does require petrol which is its main downfall as its very vunerable when its stationary and once its petrol runs out durning a skirmish its often the case the unit has to be abandoned.  During the process of invasions these units can be very useful by both defending and attacking forces as they can quickley be mobilised to clean up pockets of forces.  These units are not so good for prolonged conflicts though as, reprettieve use of these units will allow them to fall pray to matilda and sherman tanks who can quickley take them out.

								<B>Matilda MkI</B>
								<BR />
								The first of the two Matilda tanks, this tank, is more of a moible machine gun post as it does not really carry any large guns.  This is however heavily armoured, and some serious shells are needed to breech this unit.  This give it a uniqie advantage to drive straight at enemy troop and not get effective by their fire.  This said the Matilda MkI tank is slow moving, and its main weekness is its lack of firepower and the tracks can easly be targeted to take the unit out.

								<B>Matilda MkII</B>
								<BR />
								The second Matilda tank, a real moster of a unit.  This unit has the defencive power of some serious plated armour and the punch of a 2lb gun.  This unit can be expected to be the last remaning unit on the battlefield due to its extream duriblity and firepower.  However this unit is very cumbersome to control and very slow.  Its possible for other tanks on the battlefield to out maovoure this tank so, get better chance at hitting it however it will take more hits to destroy.

								<B>Sherman Tank</B>
								<BR />
								The sherman tank is unit that differs a lot from the other types of Matilda tank.  The Sherman tank is much faster and can outmanouver the Matilda tanks with no problem.  The tanks firewpower is up there with the Matilda MkII too with a strong turret capable of using armour pearcing shells.  The Sherman however has poor protection and while the sloping design does allow it to skim some shells, a direct hit will take out this tank.  As with the Matilda MkI the tracks are exposes and a well places shot can leave the tank paralysed and a sitting duck.

								<B>Supermarine Spitfire MkI</B>
								<BR />
								The Supermarine Spitfire MkI is the first of the soley metal construction fighters.  Originally based on the racing planes developed by Supermarine with the unique curved wing.  The Spitfire MkI carries 4 browning 303 machine guns in each wing and can also carry up to 3 bombs for that extra punch against ground targets (however they are not normally fitted).  These planes are good once in the air but they have a very long nose and are not easy to manovour on the ground.  Spitfires are very powerful and thus are best at taking on other figher aircraft.

							<TD class="norm" valign="top">
								<B>Supermarine Spitfire MkII</B>
								<BR />
								The Supermarine Spitfire MkII, is mainly the same basic design as the Spitfire MkI, with a few imporvments.  Firstly the merlin engine in the Spitfire MkI has been imporved to make it faster and more reliable giving the Spitfire MkII greater speed over the Spitfire MkI but this also leads to an higher turning radius so its not as manoverable.  The second improvement is than one of the broning 303 machine guns in each wing has been replaced with a 20mm cannon, which is much better for dealing with enemy fighters at close range as the one shot provides much more impact.

								<B>Supermarine Spitfire MkV</B>
								<BR />
								The Supermarine Spitfire MkV, again mostly the same as its predecessor, this time featuring rockets.  The mouting under the wings of this model can hold up to 10 rockets which can detonate on impact or 3 seconds after launch.  Again the engine has been improved but again this has given the plane a wider turining radius.

								<B>Hawker Hurricane</B>
								<BR />
								The Hawker Hurricane made it onto the scene a year earlier than the Spitfire MkI did.  The Hurricane has one key difference between the Spitfire MkI which is hudgley disputed as to wether it is an advantage or a disadvantage.  The Hurricane has a fabric cover and a partly wooden construction, some people argue that is is going back to the days of bi-planes but it does give the hurricane the extra durablity needed to take on the bombers.  As with the Spitfire the Hurricane has a Roles Royce Merlin engine and 8 Browning 303 machine gunes.

								<B>Halifax Bomber</B>
								<BR />
								The halifax bomber is the first in the new range of bombers, with turret guns mounted round the aircraft so it can defend itself.  The Halifax is not overly fast and can be rather cumbersome to fly.  These planes dont carry as much payload as the lancaster but they are quite effective in large numbers at decimating enemy industry.

								<B>Wellington Bomber</b>
								<BR />
								The Wellington bomber is the next advancement in bomber technology able to carry much more for its size and weight.  This bomber still has not overcome the difficulties in navigation at night but can carry a much larger array of bombers.  The bomber is faster and more durable allowing to to return from more missions.

								<B>Lancaster Bomber</B>
								<BR />
								The Lancaster solves the problem of navigation at night with the intorduction of the G navigation system.  This bomber like the Wellington can hold more for its weight than the Halifax can.  This unit is much more durable than the other bombers and can be used in round the clock bombing setups.

								<B>Landing Craft</B>
								<BR />
								Landing craft are used to move infantry and commandoes to and from other continents for both attacking and defencive forces.  Each landing craft can hold up to 100 infantry or commandoes per trip.

								Landing ships are uses to move tanks and jeeps to and from other continents for both attacking and defensive focres.  Each landing ship can carry a total of 30 units.

								<B>Frigates</B>
								<BR />
								Frigates are the smallest class of the navys war ships.  They are able to go to shallower waters and are therefore more suseptiable to mines than the larger battleships.  These units will engage combat with all other naval units, but need to be in groups to out-class anything larger than itself.

								<B>Battleships</B>
								<BR />
								Battleships, are the most powerful ships in the navey, bosting several large guns on each side, along with torpedo tubes and anti-aircraft guns.  These ships can roam the seas and maul other eneny ships they come accross.  These ships are much more powerful than frigates but have a much higher price.

							<TD class="norm" valign="top">
								<B>Aircraft Carrier</B>
								<BR />
								Aircraft Carriers can hit both land targets and ships well out of the rage of the target so the ship itself is gennerally quite safe.  These units however do move slowly and therefore once in range can be very easy to sink as they are very lightly armoured.
