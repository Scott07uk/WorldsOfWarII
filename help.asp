			<U>
				What is Worlds of War II?
			</U>
			<Br />
			Worlds of War II is a free, browser based online strategy game based on World War II.
			<BR />
			<BR />
			<U>
				How do I play Worlds of War II?
			</U>
			<BR />
			To get started with the basics of Worlds of War II, read the manual and ask other players by joining the IRC network. Links to both of these are on the left when you log in to the game.
			<BR />
			<BR />
			<U>
				I have never played anything like this before. Where do I start?
			</U>
			<BR />
			Your first port of call will be the manual, this should answer most questions as to the technical side of playing and what pages do what. However, we like to think this is only a small part of the game and that a community aspect is of equal importance. If you understand everything but want to be able to play better, ask the other players in your continent using the continent forum and IRC. Remember, the creators are programmers and may not be as strong with the tactics of the game. As scary as it is, there are people who know more about this game than we do!
			<BR />
			<BR />
			<U>
				Someone is attacking me! Why?
			</U>
			<BR />
			People often attack others in Worlds of War II to capture land and build the strength of their own nation. You can play Worlds of War II peacefully, but don't expect other people to!
			<BR />
			<BR />
			<U>
				I think someone is cheating. How do I report it?
			</U>
			<BR />
			On the left of this page there is a link for reporting people who are cheating. Use that and the admins will deal with it as quickly as possible.

			<BR />
			<U>
				I tried to register but I'm told my email address is inactive.
